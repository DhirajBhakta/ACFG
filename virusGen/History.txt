
 [ Version History ]
 
 At the moment i try to release a newer version every week.
 Ok, the kernel and API Search are pretty random I guess, next
 will be to power up the encrypting/decrypting part.

 Until now, all versions are BETA !!! Keep this in mind please :)


 *Version 0.30 - 29-06-2001
  Hrhr, seems as if Mr. Kasperky wants to play, he added
  the Constructor.Win32.NGVCK to the virus database, but
  he just detects the Kit, not the generated viruses, the
  heuristic still just shows a suspicion... Eugene, I am
  very very disappointed ! I expected more from you and your
  team, we both know that this kit will generate much stronger
  viruses soon ( a month or two ) until then you should detect
  'em all, I know you are able to do this. Mail me for questions .. ;)
  If you detect them all until VB2001, you'll get a sixpack
  of beer from me

  Included a slightly different Kernel Search Method
  and made other stuff more different. Mostly the API Search
  and the kernel search.

 *Version 0.29 - 22-06-2001
  Included CRC32 Api Search as seen in Billy Belecebs
  Windows Virus Writing Guide.

 *Version 0.28 - 15-06-2001
  Added a simple CRC Api Search, and will expand this
  to an additional CRC32 Api Search Method to make the virus
  more variable in structure ( and opcode of course )

 *Version 0.27 - 01-06-2001
  More (stupid) bugs fixed, caused by more variability i added
  last thursday.. maybe i should never add something the last day
  before the release =)
  I also added a slightly different api search routine, which does
  not compute the length of the names during searching, but has fixed
  values.
  In addition to this i also prepared the addition of crc based api
  searching.
 
 *Version 0.26 - 27-05-2001
   3 in the Api Find
   2 in the Find Files   
 
   ...all in all 40 viruses created and tested, and just
   5 bugs found ( and corrected.. seems good =)

 *Version 0.25 - 18-05-2001
   Removed the SEH part and put Antidebugging and Anti Bait together
   Fixed 2 bugs in the find files routine
   Fixed a bug inside the encryption routine
   And got another on inside the infection routine.
   ... two inside the Api Find Routine

   Slowly i got the impression, someone is sneeking every night into
   my room and adding newer bugs :P


 *Version 0.24 - 11-05-2001
   I found a lot this time, don't know wheter it is good, because i found
   the bugs, or bad, because this means all releases before just suck.. :P

   Fixed 3 bugs in the find files routines, 2 bugs in the encryption routines,
   2 bugs in the api search routine. And one bug each in the api found,
   anti soft ice check and anti bait check routines.
   Never give me asm code in the night and ask me to debug it please =)

 *Version 0.23 - 07-05-2001
   Fixed a bug in the Delta Handle routine
   Fixed a bug in the movRegisterValue routine
   Fixed malplaced comments

 *Version 0.22 MTX#3 Release - 19-02-2001
   Just minor changes, I got no time at the moment :(
   University means lots of work...

 *Version 0.21 - 31-01-2001
   Removed some really stupid bugs from the encryption routine
   and made it more variable. I also added an SEH anti debugging
   trick and included some trash code to make it more variable.

 *Version 0.20 - 16-01-2001
   I added encryption ( even if it is not completely random ), but
   just simple algorithms, nothing with a key, but XOR and SUB/ADD
   will follow soon =) Hope I can do this till friday, so I can give out
   a first beta to some ppl. Every opcode except the ones in the crypt
   routines are random, so no simple scanstring can be choosen. But the
   ones inside the crypt routine will be made variable too.
 
 *Version 0.14 - 08-01-2001
   Ok, there are round about 99% of the opcodes random
   ( they can be replaced by another ), the few others are either
   "ret"s ( which i will replace tomorrow ) or an instruction, with 
   at least one random parameter ( register / offset / constant ),
   so there are maybe 20 Bytes static, but these are always at a 
   different place and in a different order, so I think they will 
   not make a reliable scanstring... ;)
   But I will remove them too... But first I want to add some
   other viral tricks ( anti-debugging, anti-bait, encryption )
   which the user might select to include. ( This will also change
   the behavior of the viruses )

 *Version 0.13 - 25-12-2000
   Ok, now 3/4 are completely random, will continue with the rest...

 *Version 0.12 - 18-12-2000
   The output is now ok, and understandable ;) I added a lot of comments
   and formatted them. Got not much time at the moment to work on the
   engine itself, because I still got to find some x-mas presents and
   i got more work at university. So I just worked over 1/4 of the current engine
   to make it more variable, but till now, I found at least one replacement for
   every opcode and structure inside the 3 modules.

 *Version 0.10 - 13-13-2000
   The Kit works stable ! All generated Viruses work, infect the current and
   ( if choosen ) the windows and system directory. I will now read some poly
   tutors and papers to improve the randomness of it, and made some improvements
   of the really crappy output-design ;)

 *Version 0.02 - 11-12-2000
   Most generated viruses work ! ( so I hope I can finish this basis of the kit this week ) 
   I found out that the Digital Hackers' Alliance Randomized Encryption Generator [DREG]
   which was created by Gothmog/DHA also tried to create viruses this way. Due to the
   fact that all samples from him get detected, I'll try to give my best to avoid this ;)
   I will take a look at his VCK and hope to learn from his output.
   ( heh, Gothmog, if you are still around, give me a call.. :P )

 *Version 0.00 - 20-11-2000
   Generates simple Win32 Viruses
   NOP is the only trash instruction
   lot's of bugs ;(
