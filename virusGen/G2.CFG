; Default configuration file for Gý version 0.70á
; Written by Dark Angel of Phalcon/Skism
; Lines beginning with semicolons denote comments
; There is only rudimentary syntax checking, so conform to the format shown
; by the examples.  Parameters may appear in any order.

; Required parameters:

; Filename = <string>
; This is the filename to be generated by Gý as the source code file.
Filename = target.asm

; Infect = (C,E)
; COM, EXE
; Note: You can mix the two, a la "Infect = C,E"  Do not use a space to
;       deliminate the two parameters.  Note that this parameter has no
;       default value.
Infect = C,E

; Optional parameters - Defaults are shown in square brackets

; VirusName = <string>
; The name of the virus should be placed here.  This string will appear
; directly in the virus code.  The only limitation to the string is that
; you may not use both the single and double quotes together in the string,
; i.e. the string B'li"p is not legal.
VirusName = [Gý Virus]

; AuthorName = <string>
; The same constraints apply to AuthorName.
AuthorName = Phalcon/Skism

; Resident = <Y,N>
; (Yes, [No])
; Yes specifies the creation of a memory resident virus.
; No  specified the creation of a runtime virus.  (Duh!)
Resident = N

; ResID = XX,XX
; ([DA,PS], XX,XX )
; XX and XX are words.  If you find that the virus crashes all the time, then
; change the values.  The first value is passed to the int 21h handler and the
; second is returned from the handler.  Choose the values wisely.  This option
; is only meaningful in resident viruses.
ResID = DA,PS

; Encrypted = <Y,N>
; (Yes, [No])
; Only turn off encryption if you wish to limit the size of the virus.  Gý
; generates a random encryption function for the virus if this option is
; enabled.
Encryption = Y

; IDWord = XX
; ([  ],XX)
; The IDWord consists of two characters which are used to identify already
; infected EXE files.  This option is not needed in COM-only infectors. Do
; not use an apostrophe (') or the source code will not assemble properly.
IDWord = DA

; MinSize = #
; (A,[0]..65535)
; MinSize is used only in the infection of COM files.  Files under MinSize
; bytes are not infected.  MinSize = 0 turns off this option.  MinSize = A
; indicates use of the virus's effective length as the minimum size.  This
; line is ignored in EXE-specific infectors.
MinSize = 0

; MaxSize = #
; (A,[0]..65535)
; MaxSize is used only in the infection of COM files.  Files above MaxSize
; bytes are not infected.  MaxSize = 0 turns off this option.  MaxSize = A
; indicates automatic calculation of maximum size. This line is not needed
; in EXE-only infectors.
MaxSize = A

; Infections = #
; ([0]..65535)
; Infections is an optional counter limiting the number of infections per run
; of the virus to a specific number.  Setting infections = 0 disables this
; option.  This is only meaningful in runtime viruses.  This option is highly
; recommended, as infection of all the files in a large directory may take an
; extended period of time.
Infections = 3

; ErrorHandler = <Y,N>
; (Yes, [No])
; ErrorHandler selects if you wish to include a short critical error handler
; in the virus.  This handler prevents Abort, Retry, Fail messages by taking
; over the critical error interrupt.  Attempted infection of files on write-
; protected diskettes will not generate an error if this option is set.
ErrorHandler = N

; CommandCom = <Y,N>
; (Yes, [No])
; This flag indicates whether you wish the virus to infect COMMAND.COM.
; Setting the value to 'Yes' turns off the check for COMMAND.COM, thus
; saving space.  This currently only functions in nonresident viruses.
CommandCom = N

; AllowZero = <Y,N>
; (Yes, [No])
; This flags whether the virus will allow an encryption value of 0, which
; would effectively leave it in an unencrypted state.  'Yes' disables the
; zero check, thereby shortening code length.
AllowZero = Y

; AntiDebugger = <Y,N>
; (Yes, [No])
; This flags whether the virus will be debugger-resistant.  This is only
; meaningful in nonresident viruses.
AntiDebugger = Y
