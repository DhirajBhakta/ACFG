POSSIBLE POINTS OF FAILURE:
1) i've given just one pattern for complex ASM statements that break down to multiple MAIL statements, ; the paper requires each MAIL stmt to be given a pattern, but ive given just one pattern to the whole thing.

eg: XCHG : is broken down into 3 assignment MAIL statements.
	   so the pattern must be "ASSIGN","ASSIGN","ASSIGN"
	   But ive just given ASSIGN once....
